This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## For easy Demo View
I’ve created a ZIP folder that supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can run the demo locally by starting the appropriate file (for example, on Windows run start-windows.bat).

Important: Run the file as Administrator so it can install the required dependencies. After installation, copy the example URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) shown in the terminal and paste it into your browser.

If you need help viewing the demo, please reach out and I’ll guide you through the process.
